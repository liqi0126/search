        Returns a list of legal actions for an agent
        agentIndex=0 means Pacman, ghosts are >= 1

        we assume ghosts act in turn after the pacman takes an action

        Returns the child game state after an agent takes an action

        gameState.isWin():
        Returns whether or not the game state is a winning state

        gameState.isLose():
        Returns whether or not the game state is a losing state

        self.evaluationFunction(state)
        Returns pacman SCORE in current state (useful to evaluate leaf nodes)

        self.depth
        limits your minimax tree depth (note that depth increases one means
        the pacman and all ghosts has already decide their actions)
